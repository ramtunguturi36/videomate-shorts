- **Load Balancing**: Automatic traffic distribution

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- **Docker Support**: Consistent development and production environments
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Better logging and metrics
- **Zero-downtime Deployments**: Blue-green deployment strategy

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Koyeb
```bash
# Option 1: Use the deployment script
./deploy-koyeb.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
./deploy-koyeb.sh   # Linux/Mac

# Option 2: Manual deployment via web interface
# Go to https://app.koyeb.com and follow KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### 2. Set Up Secrets
In the Koyeb dashboard, create these secrets:
- `mongodb-uri`
- `jwt-secret`
- `google-client-id` (if using Google OAuth)
- `google-client-secret` (if using Google OAuth)
- `r2-account-id`
- `r2-access-key-id`
- `r2-secret-access-key`
- `r2-bucket-name`
- `r2-public-url`
- `razorpay-key-id`
- `razorpay-key-secret`

### 3. Test Your Deployment
- Backend health check: `https://your-api-url.koyeb.app/api/health`
- Frontend: `https://your-frontend-url.koyeb.app`
- Test authentication flow
- Test file uploads
- Test payment integration

### 4. Update DNS (When Ready)
- Point your domain to Koyeb services
- Update any hardcoded URLs in your code
- Test thoroughly before switching

## Local Development

You can now develop locally using Docker:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to Render:
1. Keep your Render services running during migration
2. Test Koyeb deployment thoroughly
3. Only switch DNS after confirming everything works
4. Keep Render configuration as backup
